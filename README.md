Download Piper voice models

    Place your .onnx and .onnx.json files inside one of these directories:

        ~/.local/share/piper/voices # For Linux
```

python gui.py
```
Keyboard Shortcuts

    Ctrl+O — Open PDF

    Space — Start/Pause reading

    Esc — Exit focus mode

 Voice Models

Piper voices come in .onnx and .onnx.json pairs. Example:
```bash
en_US-ryan-high.onnx
en_US-ryan-high.onnx.json
```
To install a new voice:
```bash
curl -L -o ~/.local/share/piper/voices/en_US-ryan-high.onnx \
     "https://example.com/en_US-ryan-high.onnx?download=true"
curl -L -o ~/.local/share/piper/voices/en_US-ryan-high.onnx.json \
     "https://example.com/en_US-ryan-high.onnx.json?download=true"
```
 Troubleshooting

    Invalid Piper JSON: Ensure the .onnx.json file is valid JSON. Re-download if needed.

    No voices found: Check the VOICE_DIRS list in util.py and place your voices accordingly.

    Focus mode stuck: Press Esc to exit or disable it from the toolbar.

  Making a Shell Alias (Optional)

  ```bash
 echo 'alias readie="python3 /Path/To/gui.py"' >> ~/.bashrc
 source ~/.bashrc
   
  ```

now you can run Readie Chan just by typing readie on the terminal :3
